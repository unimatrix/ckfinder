# Unimatrix CKFinder
CKFinder package for [Unimatrix/Backend](https://github.com/unimatrix/backend)

The main point of this package was to have a single vendor directory when using Unimatrix/Backend.

* This package contains **only** the PHP connector of CKFinder 3 (CKSource/CKFinder) with very small adjusments to make it work seamlessly with the CakePHP framework.
* Besides the small adjustments, I've also removed support for Azure, Dropbox and Amazon Web Services because they were installing outdated packages that are no longer maintained.
